		"description": "Your calm and persistent nature clearly supports your excellent math performance, where precision and steady practice pay off well. In Reading & Writing, your thoughtful approach helps with comprehension and accuracy but slight room for growth remains, particularly in areas that challenge you to push beyond comfort. While you naturally avoid stress, gently leaning into more challenging reading passages or timed exercises can help you break through any plateaus. Your strength lies in consistency and emotional balanceâ€”continuing to cultivate these will serve you well."

		"title": "Your Study Plan: Based On You",
		"description": "For Reading & Writing, focus on practicing challenging passages that stretch your critical thinking and timing yourself to build comfort under pressure. Also, review vocabulary in context to deepen understanding without rushing. In Math, maintain your excellent accuracy by revisiting problem types where you feel slightly less confident and incorporate mixed practice sets to simulate test conditions. Mindset-wise, allow yourself permission to embrace short bursts of productive challenge, knowing that occasional discomfort leads to growth. Remember to balance this with your natural tendency for calm and steady progress to avoid burnout."
