    "title": "Your SAT Practice Snapshot",
    "description": "Your current SAT practice shows a total score of 1090, with a Reading & Writing score of 380 and a Math score of 710. Your reading accuracy is notably lower than your math accuracy, reflecting uneven performance across sections. The gap between your current total and your goal score of 1550 indicates room for focused improvement. Your math efforts demonstrate strong accuracy, suggesting a solid foundation to build on, while your reading and writing areas present clear opportunities for growth. Your steady approach and existing strengths provide a promising base for targeted progress."

    "title": "What This Means For You",
    "description": "Your Persistent Hiker persona supports steady progress through calm focus but may limit engagement with more demanding challenges. Academic Strengths: Your math performance, especially in Algebra and Advanced Math, aligns with your methodical mindset and ability to maintain consistent effort. In Reading & Writing, your relative strength in Information and Ideas and Expression of Ideas reflects your thoughtful and deliberate learning style. Growth Areas: Craft and Structure in Reading & Writing and Geometry and Trigonometry in Math are areas where deeper engagement will yield significant gains; addressing these will require embracing manageable challenges that stretch your current comfort zone. Closing Insight: Reaching your goal score will depend on balancing your steady approach with targeted efforts to push beyond familiar territory."
