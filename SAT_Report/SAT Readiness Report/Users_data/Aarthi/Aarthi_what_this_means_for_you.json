Aarthi approaches SAT preparation with steady, consistent effort that prioritizes mental well-being and sustainable progress over intense pressure. This approach aligns with a balanced learning style that values emotional stability and thoughtful, deliberate study habits. A meaningful challenge lies in the tendency to avoid academic pressure that could push beyond comfort zones, which may limit growth in more demanding areas. Introducing incremental challenges framed as manageable steps, combined with occasional collaboration with peers who maintain a slightly higher intensity, can help expand capacity without disrupting established balance.
