Your approach to studying reflects a steady and thoughtful mindset. You value balance and emotional stability, which helps you maintain consistent progress without burning out. This calm persistence is a strength, but it also means you might shy away from the tougher challenges that could push your skills further. Recognizing when to step outside your comfort zone will be key to breaking through any plateaus. Small, manageable challenges can help you grow without disrupting your sense of harmony.

### Mini Study Plan  
Focus your next phase of study on targeted practice in Craft and Structure questions to improve precision and confidence. Incorporate brief, timed drills that introduce a mild challenge without overwhelming your routine. Pair these with regular review sessions of your strongest domains to maintain momentum. Consider occasional group study with peers who push a bit harder to create a productive, low-pressure competitive environment. Track small wins to keep motivation aligned with your steady approach.
