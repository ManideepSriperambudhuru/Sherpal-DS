    "The preparation approach reflects a steady, balanced mindset that values consistent progress without sacrificing emotional well-being. Strength lies in maintaining calm and thoughtful study habits that support sustainable growth and academic focus. A notable challenge is the tendency to avoid academic pressure that could push beyond comfort zones, potentially limiting performance gains. Introducing incremental challenges aligned with personal pacing can help bridge this gap while preserving mental balance."
