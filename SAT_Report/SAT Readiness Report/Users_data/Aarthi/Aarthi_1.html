  <h2>Your Learning Persona</h2>
  <p>Hello Aarthi, as a Persistent Hiker, you approach your SAT preparation with steady focus and a clear sense of balance. You value emotional stability and sustainable progress, which helps you maintain calm under pressure and stay consistent over time. Your thoughtful and deliberate nature supports deep understanding, though you may sometimes avoid pushing into uncomfortable challenges that could accelerate growth. Embracing small, manageable challenges will help you stretch without disrupting your inner balance and keep your momentum moving forward.</p>

  <h2>Your SAT Practice Snapshot</h2>
  <p>Your current Reading & Writing score stands solidly in the low 700s, while your Math score is near perfect, contributing to a total score just above fifteen hundred. Your reading accuracy shows room for refinement, whereas your math accuracy is exceptionally high. With your goal set slightly above your current total, your steady effort and strong math foundation position you well to close the gap with focused adjustments.</p>

  <h2>What This Means For You</h2>
  <p><strong>Persona Strength and Challenge:</strong> Your Persistent Hiker mindset supports calm, consistent progress but can lead to avoiding the academic stretch needed to break through plateaus.</p>
  <p><strong>Academic Strengths:</strong> Your high accuracy in Information and Ideas and Standard English Conventions reflects your thoughtful and balanced approach to reading and writing. In math, your perfect accuracy in Algebra and Problem-Solving aligns with your steady, deliberate learning style.</p>
  <p><strong>Growth Areas:</strong> Craft and Structure in Reading & Writing is your lowest domain and improving here will sharpen your analytical skills, which may require embracing more active challenge. In Math, Advanced Math shows slight room for growth; focusing here can sustain your momentum without disrupting your balance.</p>
  <p><strong>Closing Insight:</strong> Your goal score is within reach if you integrate targeted challenges that respect your pace but push your limits thoughtfully.</p>
