    "description": "Hello Ishan, as a Tenacious Explorer, you approach learning with a sharp eye for detail and a methodical mindset that suits complex problem-solving well. You naturally excel in analyzing patterns and logical structures, which gives you an edge in math and science. At times, you may hesitate to trust your first instincts, which can slow your pace and affect confidence during timed tests. To balance this, focus on building trust in your answers through timed drills and positive feedback loops. Your diligence and precision are assets that, when paired with growing self-trust, will strengthen your overall performance."

    "title": "What This Means For You",
    "description": "Your Tenacious Explorer mindset supports your strength in detailed analysis but can also lead to second-guessing that slows you down. In Reading & Writing, your highest accuracy in Expression of Ideas aligns with your thoroughness and attention to detail, while your perfect scores in Algebra and Advanced Math reflect your logical strengths. Growth areas include Craft and Structure in Reading & Writing, where refining your understanding will improve comprehension speed, and Problem-Solving and Data Analysis in Math, where boosting confidence in applying concepts under time pressure is key. Meeting your goal score will require targeted focus on these areas to complement your existing strengths."
