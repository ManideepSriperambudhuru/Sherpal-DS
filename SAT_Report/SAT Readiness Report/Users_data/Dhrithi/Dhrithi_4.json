    "description": "As a Thoughtful Pathfinder, you approach learning with emotional intelligence and resilience, maintaining calm under pressure and reflecting deeply on your progress. You value meaningful understanding over quick fixes and prefer autonomy in your study process. Your self-awareness helps you recognize how mindset influences your performance. At the same time, maintaining consistent focus and managing time effectively can be challenging, especially without external structure. Building accountability and connecting your goals to personal values will support steady progress."

    "description": "Currently, your Reading & Writing and Math scores are at the starting point, with no recorded accuracy in either domain. This baseline reflects the beginning of your preparation journey. Your goal score is ambitious and achievable with steady, focused effort. The absence of current data offers a clear opportunity to build foundational skills and establish consistent study habits. Your thoughtful approach positions you well to make meaningful progress as you engage with the material."
