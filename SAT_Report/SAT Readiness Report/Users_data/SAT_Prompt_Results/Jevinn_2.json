    "title": "What This Means For You",
    "description": "Your Persistent Hiker persona shines through your calm and steady approach, which supports your strength in Math but can sometimes lead to avoiding the tougher challenges in Reading & Writing. Academically, your Math skills, especially in Algebra and Advanced Math, reflect your balanced and thoughtful learning style, while your moderate Reading & Writing skills in Information and Ideas and Expression of Ideas show your ability to engage thoughtfully with content. Growth areas include Craft and Structure in Reading & Writing and Geometry and Trigonometry in Math, where focused effort will help you push beyond comfort zones and build confidence. With your goal score in sight, remember that strength doesn’t always roar—sometimes it whispers, ‘try again tomorrow,’ and your steady persistence will carry you there."
