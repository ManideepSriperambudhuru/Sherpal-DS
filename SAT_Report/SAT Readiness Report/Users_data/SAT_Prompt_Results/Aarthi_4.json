    "description": "Aarthi, as a Persistent Hiker, you bring a calm, balanced approach to your SAT preparation that values steady progress and emotional well-being. Your thoughtful and deliberate mindset helps you maintain harmony in your studies, allowing you to stay resilient without feeling overwhelmed. While your preference for comfort and avoiding stress supports your mental health, it can sometimes hold you back from embracing challenges that stretch your abilities.

    "description": "Your current SAT scores show strong performance, with a solid Reading & Writing score and an excellent Math score, combining for a total that’s close to your ambitious goal. Your reading accuracy reflects consistent understanding, while your math accuracy is outstanding, demonstrating your clear strengths in that area. These results highlight your steady effort and the promise you have to reach your target score with focused refinement and continued dedication."

    "title": "What This Means For You",
    "description": "Your Persistent Hiker persona shines through your calm and steady academic strengths, though your natural tendency to avoid stress can sometimes limit pushing into challenging areas. In Reading & Writing, your strong grasp of Information and Ideas and Standard English Conventions reflects your thoughtful and balanced learning style, while your perfect accuracy in Algebra and Problem-Solving in Math shows your ability to maintain focus and precision under pressure. Growth areas include Craft and Structure in Reading & Writing, where deeper engagement will enhance your comprehension, and Advanced Math, where refining complex concepts can boost your confidence and performance; approaching these with gentle, incremental challenges aligns well with your preference for harmony over pressure. With your goal score in sight, remember that strength doesn’t always roar—sometimes it whispers, ‘try again tomorrow,’ encouraging you to keep moving forward steadily and with quiet determination."
