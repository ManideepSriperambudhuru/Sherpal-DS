    "description": "Your current SAT practice shows a strong foundation in Math, where you demonstrate solid accuracy and confidence, while Reading & Writing presents more room for growth. With a total score of 1090, including a higher Math score and a lower Reading & Writing score, you have a clear path to reach your ambitious goal of 1550. Your reading accuracy suggests that focusing on comprehension and structure will unlock new potential, while your math accuracy reflects your steady effort and promise in that area. This snapshot highlights both your dedication and the exciting opportunities ahead."

    "title": "What This Means For You",
    "description": "Your Persistent Hiker persona shines in your calm persistence and steady progress, but it also means you might shy away from the academic challenges that stretch your limits. Academically, your strength lies in your solid math skills, especially in algebra and advanced math, reflecting your thoughtful and deliberate approach. In Reading & Writing, your better performance in Information and Ideas and Expression of Ideas aligns with your balanced mindset and reflective nature. Growth areas include Craft and Structure in Reading & Writing and Geometry and Trigonometry in Math; improving these will deepen your understanding and help you push beyond comfort zones in a manageable way. With your goal score in sight, remember that strength doesn’t always roar—sometimes it whispers, ‘try again tomorrow.’"
