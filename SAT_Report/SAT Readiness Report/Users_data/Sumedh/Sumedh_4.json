    "description": "Your Summit Strategist persona aligns well with your strength in Math, where your methodical preparation and attention to detail have resulted in perfect accuracy, but your preference for control may challenge you in less predictable Reading & Writing sections. Academically, your highest Reading & Writing domain shows strong command of expression, matching your ability to manage complex structures, while your flawless Math domains reflect your logical mindset and planning skills. Growth areas include the Information and Ideas domain in Reading & Writing, where deeper engagement with varied content will enhance comprehension under pressure, and although your Math scores are perfect, maintaining this level requires ongoing simulation of test conditions to avoid rigidity. Your goal score is within reach if you continue refining your Reading & Writing skills and incorporate adaptability into your test strategy."
