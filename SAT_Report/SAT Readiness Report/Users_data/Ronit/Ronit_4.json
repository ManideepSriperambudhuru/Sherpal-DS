  {
    "title": "What This Means For You",
    "description": "Your Tenacious Explorer persona supports your strength in detailed analysis but also reveals a challenge in committing confidently under time pressure. In Reading & Writing, your strongest areas are Standard English Conventions and Expression of Ideas, which align with your careful attention to language structure and clarity. In Math, Advanced Math shows relative strength, reflecting your ability to handle complex, logical sequences. Growth areas include Information and Ideas in Reading & Writing and Problem-Solving and Data Analysis in Math; improving these will enhance your ability to interpret and apply concepts efficiently, addressing hesitation and second-guessing. Your goal score is ambitious but achievable with focused work on these targeted domains and confidence-building strategies."
