In Math, refine precision and timing on Equivalent expressions, Systems of two linear equations, Linear inequalities, Area and volume, and Lines, angles, and triangles. Reduce careless errors by building trust in initial answers under moderate time pressure. Strengthen reasoning and decision-making to minimize second-guessing. Track progress through performance review cycles to steadily elevate confidence and accuracy."

Begin the week targeting weakest skills—Transitions and Equivalent expressions—progressing midweek to moderate skills like Inferences and Systems of equations. Fridays emphasize review and error analysis to consolidate learning. Saturdays are reserved for a full-length SAT practice test under timed conditions, followed by a detailed review to identify patterns in mistakes and adjust strategies. Sunday serves as a Flex Day for rest and adaptive activities aligned with your learning style."

Experiment with new problem-solving tools or timing techniques to discover what enhances your confidence. Challenge yourself with mixed-skill sets at a relaxed pace to maintain cognitive flexibility. Incorporate mindfulness or light physical activity to reset focus and reduce stress. Set clear, achievable goals for the upcoming week to maintain motivation and build self-trust alongside your technical mastery."
