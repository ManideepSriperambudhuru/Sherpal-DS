                        "Command of Evidence - Quantitative": "Engage in timed drills interpreting embedded graphs and tables by highlighting key numerical data, then quickly selecting evidence that justifies answers, followed by brief written paraphrases to solidify understanding and prevent misinterpretation.",
                        "Central Ideas and Details": "Read short passages and write concise summaries of central ideas and supporting details within strict time limits, then compare your summaries to model answers to refine precision and reinforce main point recognition under pressure.",
                        "Rhetorical Synthesis": "Analyze paired passages by creating synthesis charts that identify agreements, contrasts, and rhetorical appeals, then write brief paragraphs synthesizing these insights within a set time to enhance integration skills and fluency.",

Saturdays include two full-length, timed practice tests emphasizing accuracy and speed, followed by detailed mistake analysis to identify patterns and reinforce confidence. Sunday serves as a flexible rest and reflection day to recharge and adapt."
