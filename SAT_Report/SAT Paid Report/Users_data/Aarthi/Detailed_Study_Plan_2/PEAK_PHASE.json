Saturdays feature two full-length, timed practice tests emphasizing accuracy and speed optimization, followed by detailed mistake analysis to identify patterns and reinforce mental endurance. Sunday serves as a Flex Day for rest, reflection, and adaptive low-pressure activities aligned with your balanced approach."
