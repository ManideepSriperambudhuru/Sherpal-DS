Your calm focus on understanding words in context and mastering transitions is building a nuanced reading ability that will serve you well on test day. Embracing micro-challenges—those small, deliberate pushes beyond comfort—will unlock new levels of growth without disrupting your inner balance. Remember, true progress comes from knowing when to gently stretch yourself, not from forcing intensity. Pairing your consistent work with occasional group challenges can spark fresh motivation and momentum. Keep trusting your process, fine-tuning your strategies, and recognizing each small win. Your maturity and persistence are guiding you steadily toward your 1590 goal, and every thoughtful step you take now is setting the foundation for lasting success."
