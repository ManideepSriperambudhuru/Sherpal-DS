Saturdays include two full-length, timed practice tests simulating real exam conditions to build endurance and confidence, followed by detailed review sessions to identify patterns and refine strategies. Sundays serve as a Flex Day to support rest, reflection, and adaptive learning."

Experiment with new study tools or techniques, such as digital annotation apps or timed flashcard games, to gamify learning and gently push comfort zones. Participate in mixed-skill challenges with peers slightly ahead in intensity to boost motivation while maintaining harmony. Incorporate mindfulness or light physical activity to restore mental balance. Set clear, achievable goals for the upcoming week, framing challenges as growth opportunities rather than stressors."
