Midweek sessions target moderate skills to reinforce and integrate learning. Fridays are dedicated to reviewing errors and consolidating understanding. Saturdays feature a full-length timed practice test followed by a thorough review to identify patterns and adapt strategies. Sundays serve as a Flex Day to rest, reflect, and experiment with new approaches, maintaining a flexible yet consistent routine that supports sustained effort and growth."

Experiment with a new study tool or technique for one skill area, committing to mastering it over the coming week. Engage in mixed-skill challenges that combine Reading & Writing and Math to stimulate cognitive flexibility without pressure. Incorporate mindfulness or light physical activity to recharge mental energy. Set clear, achievable goals for the next week to harness curiosity within a structured plan, reinforcing discipline alongside exploration."
