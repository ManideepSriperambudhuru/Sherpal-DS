        "Leverage your curiosity by actively annotating challenging words in diverse passages and using context clues to infer meanings before checking definitions. Commit to mastering one vocabulary strategy each week to deepen your understanding rather than jumping between methods.",
        "Create a weekly outline habit where you briefly map the form and structure of passages you read, focusing on transitions and paragraph purposes. This structured reflection will anchor your flexible thinking and help you build consistent analytical routines.",
        "Pair your natural experimentation with disciplined practice by tackling paired command of evidence questions in timed sets. After each set, reflect on your evidence choices to identify patterns and refine your approach, ensuring sustained progress rather than scattered attempts.",
        "Integrate graph sketching into your study sessions to visualize nonlinear functions, committing to one function type per week. This steady focus will help you build deep expertise while satisfying your drive to explore new concepts.",
        "Adopt a ‘method of the week’ for solving systems of linear and quadratic equations—such as substitution or discriminant analysis—and practice it consistently across problems. Use habit trackers to monitor your mastery and avoid switching strategies prematurely.",
        "Develop a consistent problem-solving routine for systems of linear equations by practicing elimination and substitution methods in alternating sessions. Set short-term goals to solve a set number of problems daily, and review errors systematically to build sustained accuracy."
