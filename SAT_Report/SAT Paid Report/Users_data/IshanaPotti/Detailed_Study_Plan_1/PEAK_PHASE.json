Midweek sessions target moderate skills to maintain momentum, while Friday is dedicated to comprehensive review and error analysis. Saturdays feature two full-length, timed practice tests simulating real exam conditions to enhance endurance and confidence, followed by detailed mistake breakdowns. Sunday serves as a Flex Day to recharge and adapt your approach."
