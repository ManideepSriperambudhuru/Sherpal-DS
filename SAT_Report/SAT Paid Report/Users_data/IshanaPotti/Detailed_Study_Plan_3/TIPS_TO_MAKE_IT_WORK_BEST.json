        "Leverage your curiosity by actively annotating challenging words in diverse passages and using context clues to infer meanings before checking definitions. Commit to mastering one vocabulary strategy each week to deepen your understanding rather than jumping between methods.",
        "Create a weekly outline habit where you briefly map the form and structure of passages you read, focusing on transitions and paragraph purposes. This structured reflection will help you build sustained expertise in recognizing logical flow and improve your ability to anticipate question types.",
        "Use paired question sets to practice command of evidence, but resist the urge to switch strategies mid-practice. Instead, commit to fully mastering the process of identifying precise textual support over a set period, using self-assessments to track your accuracy and adjust your approach thoughtfully.",
        "Develop a consistent routine of sketching graphs for nonlinear functions before solving problems, integrating this visual step as a non-negotiable habit. Focus on mastering one solving technique per week (e.g., quadratic formula) to build depth, balancing your natural experimentation with disciplined practice.",
        "When working on systems of linear and quadratic equations, adopt a ‘method of the week’ approach by focusing on perfecting substitution and verification steps. Use habit trackers to ensure you check all solutions carefully, preventing careless errors and reinforcing sustained effort.",
        "Build a steady practice schedule for solving systems of linear equations using both substitution and elimination methods. Set short-term goals to master each method fully before moving on, and use weekly self-assessments to maintain focus and avoid inconsistency in your problem-solving approach."
