    "description": "Ishana, your natural curiosity and willingness to experiment are powerful assets as you deepen your mastery of SAT skills. This Elevation Phase is your moment to channel that exploratory spirit into focused, consistent effort—especially as you refine your command of evidence and tackle nonlinear math problems. Embrace the 'method of the week' approach to build lasting routines without sacrificing your love of novelty. Remember, sustained progress comes from balancing flexibility with structure: set clear short-term goals, track your habits, and reflect weekly on what’s working. Your ability to pivot and absorb feedback will keep you adaptive, but it’s your commitment to steady practice that will elevate your score from 1440 toward 1590. Keep pushing with intention—your insight and discipline together will unlock the breakthrough you’re aiming for."
