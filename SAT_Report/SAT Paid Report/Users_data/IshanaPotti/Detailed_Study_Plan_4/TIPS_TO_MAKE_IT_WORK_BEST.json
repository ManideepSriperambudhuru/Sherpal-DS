        "Leverage your curiosity by actively annotating challenging words and their context clues in diverse passages; commit to one vocabulary strategy each week to deepen mastery rather than jumping between methods.",
        "Create a weekly outline habit where you briefly map the form and structure of passages you read, focusing on transitions and paragraph purposes to build a consistent framework that supports your natural inclination to connect ideas.",
        "Use paired question sets to practice command of evidence, setting a goal to explain your answers in your own words before locating textual support; track your progress weekly to ensure you’re building sustained accuracy in linking claims to evidence.",
        "Develop a steady routine of sketching nonlinear function graphs before solving problems, dedicating each study session to mastering one solving technique (factoring, quadratic formula, etc.) to avoid scattering your focus and build deep expertise.",
        "Adopt a ‘method of the week’ approach for solving systems of linear and quadratic equations: commit to mastering substitution or discriminant interpretation fully before moving on, using habit trackers to reward consistent practice and reflection on errors.",
        "Build discipline by scheduling focused practice on systems of two linear equations using elimination and substitution methods, setting short-term goals to check solutions rigorously and reflect on mistakes to convert flexibility into reliable problem-solving habits."
