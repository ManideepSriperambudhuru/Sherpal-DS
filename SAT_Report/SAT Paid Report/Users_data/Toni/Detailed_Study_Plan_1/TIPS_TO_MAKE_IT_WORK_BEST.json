        "When encountering challenging vocabulary, focus on identifying context clues such as definitions, contrasts, or examples within the passage. Annotate these clues quickly and practice paraphrasing sentences to reinforce your understanding without overanalyzing, building trust in your initial interpretations.",
        "Approach command of evidence questions by first articulating your answer in your own words, then swiftly locating precise textual support. Use process of elimination to discard weak evidence and set strict time limits to prevent second-guessing, reinforcing confidence in your ability to connect answers with strong proof.",
        "Develop a habit of outlining passage structure as you read, noting paragraph functions and transitions. This will help you anticipate question types and maintain a clear mental map of the authorâ€™s logic, reducing hesitation and enabling faster, more accurate responses.",
        "For nonlinear functions, consistently sketch graphs before solving problems to visualize behavior and key features like vertices and intercepts. Combine this with timed drills on solving quadratic equations to build fluency and reduce overthinking during the test.",
        "When working on linear functions in word problems, practice translating scenarios into equations under timed conditions. Use diagrams or tables to organize information quickly, and regularly review slope and intercept concepts to strengthen your ability to commit confidently to answers.",
        "Master solving systems of linear and quadratic equations by practicing substitution methodically and checking solutions immediately. Incorporate confidence-building drills where you commit to answers within set times and reflect on accuracy to build trust in your problem-solving instincts."
