    "description": "Toni, your meticulous nature and sharp eye for patterns are your greatest assets as you tackle the Elevation Phase. Embrace your strength in breaking down complex problems—especially in nonlinear functions and command of evidence—while practicing the confidence to commit decisively under time pressure. Each quick-recall drill and timed exercise is not just about speed but about building trust in your instincts. Remember, progress comes from structured, sustained effort; your attention to detail paired with steady momentum will close the gap to your 1590 goal. When doubt creeps in, lean on your growing self-trust and the positive feedback from your mentors. This phase is about owning your process, learning from each step, and moving forward with purpose. Keep pushing—your analytical rigor and growing confidence are the keys to unlocking your peak performance."
