        "When tackling Words in Context, leverage your natural attention to detail by annotating passages to identify subtle context clues like synonyms, antonyms, and contrasts. Commit to quick paraphrasing drills under timed conditions to build confidence in trusting your initial interpretation without overanalyzing.",
        "For Command of Evidence questions, practice pairing your answer with precise textual support by actively underlining key phrases as you read. Use timed drills where you commit to an evidence choice quickly, then review accuracy to strengthen your trust in your analytical instincts and reduce second-guessing.",
        "To master Form, Structure, and Sense, create brief outlines of passage organization during practice to map logical flow and paragraph purpose. Challenge yourself to explain transitions aloud within a set time to reinforce clarity and decisiveness in recognizing author intent.",
        "When studying Nonlinear Functions, sketch graphs before solving problems to visualize behavior and reduce hesitation. Incorporate timed problem sets that require committing to solutions quickly, then review errors to build accuracy and confidence in handling complex function types.",
        "For Linear Functions in word problems, develop a habit of translating scenarios into equations immediately by identifying slope and intercept. Use quick-recall exercises to reinforce this process, pairing with peers or mentors for positive feedback on your speed and precision.",
        "In solving Systems of Linear and Quadratic Equations, focus on mastering substitution through repetitive, timed practice that encourages committing to solutions without overthinking. Regularly verify answers to build self-trust and use error patterns as learning opportunities rather than setbacks."
