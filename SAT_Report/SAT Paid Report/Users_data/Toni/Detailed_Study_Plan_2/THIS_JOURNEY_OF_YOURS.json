    "description": "Toni, your meticulous nature and sharp eye for patterns are your greatest assets as you tackle the Elevation Phase. Embrace your strength in breaking down complex problems, especially in nonlinear functions and command of evidence questions, where your attention to detail shines. Remember, building confidence is just as critical as technical mastery—commit to your answers within set times and trust your instincts. Each streak of correct responses is proof of your growing self-trust and skill. When second-guessing creeps in, remind yourself that progress is built on steady, structured effort, not perfection. Keep pushing forward with urgency and focus, knowing that your thoroughness and persistence are propelling you closer to your 1590 goal. This phase is about owning your process and sharpening both your mind and confidence—stay deliberate, stay driven."
