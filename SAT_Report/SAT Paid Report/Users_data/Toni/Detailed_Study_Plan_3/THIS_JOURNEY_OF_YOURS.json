    "description": "Toni, your meticulous nature and sharp eye for patterns are your greatest assets as you tackle the Elevation Phase. Embrace your strength in breaking down complex problems—whether in nonlinear functions or command of evidence—and let that fuel your confidence. Remember, committing to answers within set times is not just about speed but building trust in your instincts. Each quick-recall drill and streak of accuracy is proof of your growing mastery. When second-guessing creeps in, anchor yourself in the progress you’ve made, not past doubts. Structured habits and steady effort will transform hesitation into decisive action. Keep pushing forward with the same thoroughness and care you bring to every problem. Your goal of 1590 is within reach because you are building not just knowledge, but unshakable self-trust."
