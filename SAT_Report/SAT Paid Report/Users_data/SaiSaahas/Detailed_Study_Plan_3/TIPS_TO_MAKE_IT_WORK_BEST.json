        "Break down unfamiliar words by actively annotating context clues—look for definitions, contrasts, or examples nearby—and paraphrase sentences to confirm your understanding. Use a checklist to track daily vocabulary practice and celebrate small wins to build confidence steadily.",
        "Create a weekly outline habit where you briefly map the form and structure of passages before answering questions. Use transition words as anchors to follow the logical flow, and review your notes regularly to reinforce how each paragraph contributes to the author’s purpose.",
        "Practice identifying sentence boundaries by reading passages aloud and marking where natural pauses occur. Use micro-goals to rewrite a few sentences daily, correcting run-ons and comma splices, and reward yourself for consistent progress to build trust in your editing skills.",
        "Visualize nonlinear function graphs daily by sketching key features like vertices and intercepts before solving problems. Set small goals to master one solving technique each day—factoring, quadratic formula, or completing the square—and track your progress with a streak tracker to maintain momentum.",
        "Focus on mastering substitution method step-by-step by solving one system daily, verifying each solution carefully. Use a weekly plan to gradually increase problem complexity, and reflect on errors without judgment to build resilience and sharpen your algebraic skills.",
        "Develop a structured approach to solving systems of linear equations by alternating between substitution and elimination methods in practice sessions. Set clear micro-goals for each session, check your solutions thoroughly, and use affirming feedback to reinforce your growing accuracy and confidence."
