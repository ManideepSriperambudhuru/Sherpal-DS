Midweek sessions target moderate skills to reinforce and expand mastery. Fridays are dedicated to comprehensive review of errors and strategy refinement. Saturdays feature two full-length, timed practice tests emphasizing endurance, accuracy, and speed optimization, followed by detailed mistake analysis to identify patterns and adjust tactics. Sundays serve as a Flex Day for rest and adaptive activities aligned with personal growth."
