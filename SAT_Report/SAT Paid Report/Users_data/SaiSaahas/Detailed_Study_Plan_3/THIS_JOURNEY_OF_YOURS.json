    "description": "Sai Saahas, your resilience is your greatest asset—each restart and recalibration is a step closer to mastery. As you deepen your understanding of words in context and the structure of passages, remember that these skills build clarity and precision, essential for hitting your 1590 goal. Embrace the micro-goals and checklists as tools to create steady momentum; they transform overwhelming tasks into achievable wins. Your work with nonlinear functions and systems of equations sharpens your problem-solving agility—keep visualizing graphs and verifying solutions to build confidence. This phase demands consistent effort and structured habits, but your grit ensures you’ll rise to the challenge. Trust the process, celebrate small victories, and let each challenge be a marker of growth, not a test of worth. The path is yours to shape—stay focused, stay steady, and keep moving forward with purpose."
