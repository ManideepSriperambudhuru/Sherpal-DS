    "description": "Sai Saahas, your resilience is your greatest asset—each restart and effort builds the foundation for lasting success. As you deepen your understanding of words in context and master the structure of passages, remember that these skills sharpen your ability to think critically and read with precision. On the math front, tackling nonlinear functions and systems of equations demands steady focus and methodical practice—embrace each problem as a step forward. Structure your days with clear micro-goals and track your progress visually; these habits will transform uncertainty into momentum. Trust in your capacity to grow through challenges rather than be defined by them. Your willingness to adapt and persist is exactly what will elevate your score from 1450 toward your ambitious 1590 goal. Keep building consistency, celebrate small wins, and maintain your focus—your potential is unfolding with every deliberate effort."
