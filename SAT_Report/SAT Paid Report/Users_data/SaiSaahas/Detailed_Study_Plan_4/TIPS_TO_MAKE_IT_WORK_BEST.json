        "Break down unfamiliar words by actively annotating context clues—look for definitions, contrasts, or examples nearby—and paraphrase sentences to confirm your understanding. Use a checklist to track daily vocabulary practice and celebrate small wins to build confidence steadily.",
        "Create a weekly outline habit where you briefly summarize each passage’s form and structure before answering questions. Use transition words as anchors to map the logical flow, and review your notes regularly to reinforce clarity and coherence without pressure.",
        "Practice identifying sentence boundaries by reading passages aloud and marking punctuation that separates ideas. Use short, focused exercises to rewrite run-ons or fragments correctly, and reward yourself for consistent progress to maintain motivation and reduce overwhelm.",
        "Visualize nonlinear function graphs daily by sketching key features like vertices and intercepts before solving problems. Set micro-goals to master one solving technique at a time—factoring, quadratic formula, or completing the square—and track your progress with a streak tracker to build steady momentum.",
        "Approach systems of linear and quadratic equations by mastering substitution through step-by-step practice. Use weekly mentor check-ins to review errors and interpret discriminants, framing challenges as growth opportunities rather than tests of ability.",
        "Develop a structured routine to solve systems of linear equations using both substitution and elimination methods. Set clear, achievable goals for each session, verify solutions by plugging them back in, and use visual graphing tools to build confidence and deepen understanding incrementally."
