        "Break down unfamiliar words by actively annotating context clues—look for definitions, contrasts, or examples nearby—and paraphrase sentences to confirm your understanding. Use a checklist to track daily vocabulary practice and celebrate small wins to build confidence steadily.",
        "Create a weekly outline habit where you briefly summarize each paragraph’s purpose and note transitions. Use a visual progress tracker to mark completed passages, reinforcing your growing ability to identify structure and flow, which will boost your confidence and focus.",
        "Practice identifying sentence boundaries by rewriting run-ons and comma splices with proper punctuation daily. Use short, timed drills with immediate feedback to build a reliable sense of sentence clarity, helping you avoid common errors and maintain steady progress.",
        "Visualize nonlinear function graphs before solving problems to build intuition. Set micro-goals to master one solving technique at a time—factoring, quadratic formula, or completing the square—and track your progress with a checklist to maintain momentum and reduce overwhelm.",
        "Focus on mastering substitution in systems involving linear and quadratic equations by breaking problems into clear steps. Use weekly mentor check-ins to review errors and reinforce correct methods, turning challenges into growth opportunities and building your problem-solving resilience.",
        "Develop a routine to solve systems of linear equations using both substitution and elimination methods. Set short-term goals to practice each method separately, then combine them, using a streak tracker to reward consistency and build your internal motivation gradually."
