    "description": "Sai Saahas, your resilience is your greatest asset—each restart and effort builds the foundation for lasting success. As you deepen your understanding of words in context and master the structure of complex passages, remember that these skills sharpen your critical reading and analytical thinking. On the math front, your growing confidence with nonlinear functions and systems of equations is unlocking new problem-solving power. Embrace the structured habits we’ve set: micro-goals, checklists, and weekly plans are your tools to transform momentum into measurable progress. Challenges are not setbacks but stepping stones—each small win fuels your internal drive. Stay consistent, trust the process, and keep pushing forward with deliberate effort. Your goal of 1590 is within reach because you are building not just knowledge, but the disciplined mindset that will carry you through every test day."
