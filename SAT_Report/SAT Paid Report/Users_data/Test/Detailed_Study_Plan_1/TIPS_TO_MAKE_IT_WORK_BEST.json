        "When working on Words in Context, trust your initial interpretation of a wordâ€™s meaning based on surrounding clues before overanalyzing; use timed drills to reinforce this instinct and review errors to confirm when your first choice was correct.",
        "For Boundaries, practice identifying sentence and clause breaks aloud to internalize natural pauses, then apply this understanding under timed conditions to reduce hesitation and improve punctuation accuracy without second-guessing.",
        "In Form, Structure, and Sense exercises, focus on outlining the logical flow of passages quickly, and journal moments when trusting your structural sense led to correct answers to build confidence in decisive reading.",
        "With Nonlinear Functions, sketch graphs to visualize problem behavior quickly, then practice solving related equations under gradually increasing time limits to build fluency and reduce overthinking.",
        "For Linear Functions, create quick reference tables or graphs to translate word problems into equations efficiently, and practice trusting your first equation setup before verifying to avoid decision paralysis.",
        "When solving Systems of Linear and Quadratic Equations, develop a step-by-step substitution routine practiced under timed conditions to build automaticity, and reflect on solved problems to reinforce trust in your method and answers."
