            "description": "Each week, aim to steadily reduce careless mistakes by trusting your initial reasoning more often and completing all practice sets within moderate time limits. Focus on improving accuracy and confidence in second-tier Reading & Writing skills such as Transitions and Command of Evidence, alongside Math skills like Equivalent Expressions and Linear Equations. Develop decisiveness under timed conditions by completing mixed-skill drills with fewer hesitations and more consistent pacing. Track and celebrate moments of confident decision-making while maintaining methodical precision."
