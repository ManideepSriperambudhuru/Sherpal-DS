        "Leverage your curiosity by actively annotating challenging words in diverse passages and use context clues to infer meanings before checking definitions. Commit to mastering one vocabulary strategy each week to deepen your understanding rather than jumping between methods.",
        "Build a habit of reading sentences aloud and rewriting run-ons or comma splices into clear, punctuated sentences. Use weekly self-assessments to track your progress in applying punctuation rules consistently, reinforcing clarity through structured practice.",
        "Create brief outlines for each passage you read, focusing on identifying the form and purpose of paragraphs. Use a ‘method of the week’ to practice recognizing transitions and logical flow, committing to mastering one structural analysis technique before moving on.",
        "Visualize graphs for nonlinear functions daily, sketching curves to internalize their shapes and behaviors. Set a short-term goal to master one solving technique (like factoring or quadratic formula) each week, reflecting on errors to refine your approach systematically.",
        "Practice solving systems of linear and quadratic equations through substitution with focused, step-by-step routines. Use habit trackers to ensure you verify solutions regularly and reflect on mistakes to build accuracy and confidence under timed conditions.",
        "Develop a consistent routine for isolating variables by breaking down complex equations into manageable steps. Commit to mastering one formula rearrangement per study session, using self-checks to confirm correctness and avoid skipping critical steps."
