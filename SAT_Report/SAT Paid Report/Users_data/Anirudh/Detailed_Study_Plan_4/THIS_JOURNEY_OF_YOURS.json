    "description": "Anirudh, your thoughtful approach and deep curiosity are your greatest assets as you elevate your SAT skills. Embrace your strength in connecting ideas and understanding concepts deeply—this foundation will serve you well, especially as you refine your ability to make confident, timely decisions under pressure. Remember, progress is about steady, purposeful effort, not perfection. Each timed drill and reflective journaling moment builds your instinct and sharpens your pace. Your work on interpreting complex vocabulary in context and mastering nonlinear functions shows your readiness to tackle challenges with clarity and insight. Keep trusting your internal motivation and structured habits; they are the engine driving you toward your 1590 goal. Move forward decisively, knowing that excellence often means acting with confidence even when all details aren’t fully unraveled yet. This phase is your opportunity to transform understanding into action—own it fully."
