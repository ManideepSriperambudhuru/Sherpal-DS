        "When tackling 'Words in Context' questions, focus on annotating key context clues like synonyms, antonyms, and contrast words as you read. Practice paraphrasing sentences aloud to deepen your understanding and build confidence in trusting your interpretation rather than overanalyzing definitions.",
        "Develop a habit of briefly outlining the form and structure of passages during practice to anticipate the authorâ€™s intent and question types. Use timed drills to practice identifying paragraph purposes and transitions quickly, helping you balance your thoughtful pace with the need for efficient decision-making.",
        "In synthesis practice, challenge yourself with timed exercises that require integrating multiple sources. After each session, journal moments when your initial synthesis instincts were correct to reinforce confidence and reduce hesitation under pressure.",
        "For nonlinear functions, consistently sketch graphs before solving problems to visualize behavior and reduce overthinking. Incorporate timed problem sets that require quick identification of function types and key features to build fluency and decision speed.",
        "When working on systems of linear equations, practice translating word problems into equations with clear variable labels under timed conditions. After solving, reflect on your solution process to confirm accuracy and build trust in your problem-solving instincts.",
        "Master isolating variables by breaking down each step methodically and writing out your work clearly. Use timed drills to practice this skill, focusing on maintaining balance in equations and verifying your answers quickly to build confidence in moving forward without perfection."
