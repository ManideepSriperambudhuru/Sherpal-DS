Midweek shifts to moderate skills like Form, Structure, and Sense alongside Linear equations in two variables and Equivalent expressions. Fridays are dedicated to comprehensive review and integration of all practiced skills to reinforce learning and accuracy. Saturdays concentrate on fundamental concepts through targeted skill-building exercises and conceptual reinforcement, allowing thoughtful absorption. Reserve one Flex Day for rest, reflection, and adaptive practice to maintain cognitive balance and sustain motivation."
