        "Regularly outline passages to track their form and structure, then reflect on how each paragraphâ€™s purpose contributes to the overall argument; this will help you see progress clearly and adjust your approach when needed.",
        "Annotate challenging words by marking context clues and paraphrasing sentences aloud to deepen your understanding and reinforce vocabulary retention, ensuring you stay adaptable rather than relying on memorized definitions.",
        "Practice identifying sentence boundaries by reading sentences aloud and rewriting run-ons or fragments; this active engagement will help you internalize punctuation rules and maintain clarity under timed conditions.",
        "Sketch graphs of nonlinear functions before solving problems to visualize their behavior, and keep a growth chart of your accuracy with different solving methods to recognize patterns and fine-tune your strategies.",
        "When solving systems of linear equations, alternate between substitution and elimination methods and reflect weekly on which approach yields faster, more accurate results to avoid sticking to less effective habits.",
        "Translate word problems into equations carefully by labeling variables clearly and double-checking your setup; then review your solutions by plugging them back in to build confidence and reinforce accuracy."
