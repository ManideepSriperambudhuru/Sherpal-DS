Aim to stabilize performance under timed conditions, demonstrating consistent endurance for full-length tests. Strengthen mental and emotional control to minimize score variance and lock in effective strategies. Track measurable progress in priority skills, focusing on deeper understanding and precision rather than broad coverage."

                        "Text Structure and Purpose": "Analyze timed passages by identifying signal words and outlining the text’s structure and author’s purpose in the margins, then summarize each paragraph’s role to build speed and mastery of complex question types.",
                        "Central Ideas and Details": "After reading each passage, write a brief summary of the central idea and list supporting details in your own words to reinforce understanding and distinguish main points from minor facts.",
                        "Inferences": "Engage with medium-difficulty inference questions by annotating clues about tone and implied meaning, then justify each answer choice by linking it explicitly to textual evidence to strengthen reasoning skills.",
                        "Cross-text Connections": "Practice paired passage sets by creating comparison charts that map author purposes, tones, and evidence types, focusing on identifying agreements and contradictions to deepen synthesis skills."

                        "Right triangles and trigonometry": "Solve complex right triangle problems combining trigonometric ratios and the Pythagorean theorem, practicing labeling sides relative to angles and using inverse functions accurately with calculator proficiency.",
                        "Ratios, rates, proportional relationships, and units": "Practice multi-step word problems that require setting up proportions and performing unit conversions, writing out each step clearly to avoid errors and build confidence with advanced applications."

Fridays are dedicated to comprehensive review of errors and strategy refinement. Saturdays feature two full-length practice tests simulating real conditions to build endurance and confidence, followed by detailed mistake analysis to identify patterns. Sundays serve as a Flex Day for rest and adaptive activities aligned with personal growth."

Experiment with new study tools or alternate problem-solving approaches to encourage adaptability. Complete mixed-skill challenge sets to maintain cognitive flexibility without intensity. Incorporate mindfulness or light physical activity to recharge mentally and physically. Set clear, personalized goals for the upcoming week, focusing on strategic adjustments to accelerate progress while honoring persistence."
