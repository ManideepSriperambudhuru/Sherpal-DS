    "description": "Rohan, your calm and steady approach is a powerful asset as you elevate your SAT skills. Your ability to stay composed under pressure will anchor you through timed drills and progressively challenging problems. Now is the time to channel that quiet confidence into purposeful urgency—use countdowns and 'beat your best' challenges to push beyond comfort zones. As you deepen your understanding of nuanced vocabulary in context and master the structure of complex passages, remember that sustained, focused effort will transform good into exceptional. In math, your growing command of nonlinear functions and systems of equations will build the algebraic confidence you need to tackle the toughest questions. Keep balancing pressure with patience; your adaptability means you don’t just handle surprises—you thrive in them. This Elevation Phase is your moment to sharpen habits and intensify focus. Own it with intention, and your goal of 1590 is within reach."
