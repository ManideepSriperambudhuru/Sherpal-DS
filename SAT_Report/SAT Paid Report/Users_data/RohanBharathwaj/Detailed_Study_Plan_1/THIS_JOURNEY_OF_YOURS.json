    "description": "Rohan, your calm and steady approach is a powerful asset as you navigate the Elevation Phase. Your ability to maintain composure under pressure will serve you well, especially as you incorporate timed drills and push beyond comfort zones. Embrace the challenge of progressively harder problems in reading and math—each one is an opportunity to deepen your mastery and sharpen your focus. Remember, your quiet confidence is the foundation for sustained effort; now it’s about adding urgency to that strength. Use countdowns and 'beat your best' goals to ignite your internal drive. As you refine skills like interpreting nuanced vocabulary and solving nonlinear equations, trust that your thoughtful, adaptable mindset will help you thrive amid complexity. Keep building structured habits and stay committed—your goal of 1590 is within reach through consistent, purposeful progress."
