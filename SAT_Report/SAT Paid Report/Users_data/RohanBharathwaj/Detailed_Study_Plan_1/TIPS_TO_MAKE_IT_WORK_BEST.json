        "For Words in Context, challenge yourself with timed vocabulary drills that require quick inference from context clues. Use visible countdowns to maintain urgency and push beyond your comfort zone, ensuring you donâ€™t settle for 'good enough' but aim for precise understanding under pressure.",
        "When working on Form, Structure, and Sense, create brief outlines of passages within strict time limits to sharpen your ability to quickly identify paragraph purposes and logical flow. Gradually increase passage complexity to stretch your analytical skills while maintaining your calm, composed approach.",
        "In practicing Transitions, incorporate 'beat your best time' exercises where you identify and apply appropriate transition words under timed conditions. This subtle competition will help you sustain focus and internal urgency, improving your writing coherence without sacrificing your thoughtful style.",
        "For Nonlinear Functions, integrate timed problem sets that require quick graph sketching and equation solving. Use progressive difficulty to stretch your skills, and track your improvement with visible timers to maintain intensity and avoid complacency.",
        "When tackling Nonlinear Equations in One Variable and Systems of Equations, practice substitution and discriminant interpretation drills with a countdown timer. Challenge yourself to solve increasingly complex systems within set time frames to build both accuracy and speed while preserving your steady mindset.",
        "For Linear Equations in Two Variables, simulate real-world word problems under timed conditions, focusing on translating scenarios into equations efficiently. Use incremental challenges and track your best times to foster a healthy sense of competition that drives you to mastery without overwhelming your calm approach."
