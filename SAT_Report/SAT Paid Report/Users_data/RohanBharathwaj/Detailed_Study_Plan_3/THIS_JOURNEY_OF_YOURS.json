    "description": "Rohan, your calm and steady approach is a powerful asset as you navigate the Elevation Phase. Your ability to stay composed under pressure will anchor your progress, especially as you tackle complex reading passages and nonlinear math problems. Now, it’s time to channel that quiet confidence into deliberate urgency—embrace timed drills and challenge yourself to beat your best scores. Stretch beyond comfort by engaging with progressively harder problems, knowing that mastery lies just beyond ‘good enough.’ Your thoughtful mindset and adaptability equip you to not only handle surprises but to thrive in them. Keep building structured habits that balance pressure with encouragement, and maintain focus on the details—whether interpreting nuanced vocabulary in context or solving systems of equations. This phase is about sustained effort and intentional growth. Trust your process, push your limits, and watch your momentum carry you closer to your 1590 goal."
