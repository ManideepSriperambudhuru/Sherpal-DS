    "description": "Rohan, your calm and steady approach is a powerful asset as you navigate the Elevation Phase. Your ability to stay composed under pressure will anchor your progress, especially as you tackle complex reading passages and nonlinear math problems. Now, it’s time to channel that quiet confidence into deliberate urgency—use timed drills and 'beat your best' challenges to push beyond comfort and sharpen your focus. Embrace the stretch of progressively harder problems; they are the stepping stones to mastery. Remember, your thoughtful mindset and adaptability mean you don’t just handle surprises—you thrive in them. Keep building structured habits that balance pressure with encouragement, and you’ll transform steady effort into breakthrough results. This phase is about owning your momentum and proving to yourself that mastery is within reach. Stay intentional, stay focused, and keep moving forward with purpose."
