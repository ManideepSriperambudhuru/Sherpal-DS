        "For Words in Context, challenge yourself with timed vocabulary drills where you identify word meanings using context clues under a countdown. This will build urgency and sharpen your ability to quickly interpret nuanced language without losing your calm focus.",
        "When working on Form, Structure, and Sense, create brief outlines of passages within set time limits to track paragraph purposes and logical flow. Push yourself to analyze transitions and organization efficiently, balancing your natural composure with a steady pace that prevents complacency.",
        "For Transitions, incorporate 'beat your best time' exercises where you identify and categorize transition words in passages or your own writing. This subtle competition will help you maintain intensity and deepen your understanding of how transitions clarify relationships between ideas.",
        "In Nonlinear Functions, use timed graph sketching and equation-solving drills to build speed and accuracy. Gradually increase problem difficulty to stretch your skills while maintaining your calm, ensuring you develop both mastery and the ability to perform under pressure.",
        "For Nonlinear Equations in One Variable and Systems of Equations, practice substitution and discriminant interpretation with progressively harder problems on a timer. Track your improvement by recording solution times and accuracy, fostering a healthy internal challenge that keeps you engaged and focused.",
        "When tackling Linear Equations in Two Variables word problems, set structured practice sessions with visible countdowns and self-imposed deadlines. This will help you avoid settling for 'good enough' and encourage sustained effort in translating and solving complex real-world scenarios efficiently."
