                        "Form, Structure, and Sense": "Practice timed paragraph function identification by reading SAT passages and quickly labeling each paragraph’s role (introduction, evidence, conclusion) while annotating transitions; immediately review choices to ensure selections maintain logical flow and coherence, reinforcing mastery under pressure.",
                        "Central Ideas and Details": "Engage in active reading drills where after each paragraph you pause to write a one-sentence summary of the central idea and list supporting details, then answer SAT-style questions focusing on distinguishing main ideas from minor details, all under timed conditions to sharpen speed and accuracy.",
                        "Inferences": "Complete targeted inference question sets that require annotating textual clues and tone shifts, then justify each answer choice with explicit evidence from the passage, followed by a timed review session to identify and correct any misinterpretations, embracing a fail fast, learn faster mindset.",
                        "Command of Evidence - Quantitative": "Work on SAT passages containing embedded graphs and tables by first interpreting data visuals independently, then answering command of evidence questions step-by-step—locate claim, find exact supporting data, and confirm accuracy—under strict time limits to build confidence and precision.",
                        "Cross-text Connections": "Use paired passage exercises to create quick comparison charts mapping author’s purpose, tone, and evidence types; answer synthesis questions that require integrating information across texts, followed by a brief reflection log capturing insights and areas for improvement."

                        "Systems of two linear equations in two variables": "Solve mixed-method systems using substitution and elimination under timed conditions, carefully writing each step to avoid sign errors; include word problem translations and verify solutions by plugging values back into both equations to reinforce precision.",
                        "One-variable data: Distributions and measures of center and spread": "Analyze diverse data sets by calculating mean, median, range, and IQR, then interpret distribution shape and identify outliers using the 1.5*IQR rule; complete timed exercises comparing multiple data sets and explaining implications to solidify conceptual understanding.",
                        "Right triangles and trigonometry": "Practice problems requiring identification of opposite, adjacent, and hypotenuse sides relative to given angles; use sine, cosine, and tangent ratios and their inverses to find missing sides or angles, drawing diagrams and checking answers for reasonableness under timed conditions."

Saturdays include two full-length SAT practice tests simulating real conditions to build endurance and confidence, followed by detailed mistake analysis and reflection logs to capture lessons. Sunday serves as a Flex Day for rest, reflection, and adaptive practice aligned with personal growth strategies."

Dedicate time to structured self-reflection logs analyzing recent errors and successes, embracing the 'fail fast, learn faster' mindset. Incorporate mindfulness or light physical activity to reset cognitive energy and maintain emotional control. Update visual goal boards to include both performance and learning objectives, reinforcing motivation and forward momentum for the upcoming week."
