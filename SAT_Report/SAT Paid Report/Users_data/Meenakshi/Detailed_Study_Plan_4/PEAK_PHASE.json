Midweek shifts to moderate skills to build momentum, while Fridays are dedicated to comprehensive review and reflection on errors. Saturdays involve two full-length, timed practice tests simulating real conditions, followed by detailed mistake analysis to reinforce learning and stabilize performance. Sundays serve as a Flex Day for rest, reflection, and adaptive activities aligned with your balanced, steady approach."

Experiment with new study tools or techniques, such as digital annotation apps or timed flashcards, to gently push your comfort zone. Participate in mixed-skill, collaborative challenges with peers slightly more intense than you to boost motivation without disrupting your inner balance. Incorporate mindfulness or light physical activity like walking or yoga to support emotional stability. Set clear, achievable goals for the upcoming week, framing challenges as opportunities for growth rather than stress."
