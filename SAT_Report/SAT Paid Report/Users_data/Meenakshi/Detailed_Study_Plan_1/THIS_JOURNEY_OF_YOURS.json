    "description": "Meenakshi, your steady, thoughtful approach is a powerful asset as you refine your skills during this Elevation Phase. Your calm persistence in mastering nuanced reading strategies like \"Words in Context\" and transitions reflects a mature balance between growth and well-being. Embrace the micro-challenges ahead as opportunities to stretch just beyond comfort—each small step forward builds momentum toward your 1590 goal. Remember, true balance isn’t complacency; it’s knowing when to push yourself gently but deliberately. Lean into moments that require active struggle, especially in nonlinear functions and systems of equations, to unlock your full potential. Your ability to maintain harmony while steadily advancing is exactly what will carry you through. Keep recognizing your progress, celebrate each small win, and trust that your consistent effort is shaping the confident, capable test-taker you are becoming."
