        "When working on form, structure, and sense, practice outlining passages briefly to capture the authorâ€™s organizational choices. Use timed drills to decide quickly on paragraph purposes, then review your reasoning afterward to build confidence in trusting your initial analysis without overanalyzing.",
        "For rhetorical synthesis, focus on actively annotating texts to identify connections and contrasts between sources. After practice sessions, journal moments when your synthesis instincts aligned with correct answers to reinforce your ability to integrate ideas efficiently under time constraints.",
        "In mastering transitions, challenge yourself to select the most precise transition word that fits the logical relationship, especially in timed writing exercises. Reflect on how varying transitions affect clarity and flow, helping you move forward confidently without getting stuck on perfect wording.",
        "When studying nonlinear functions, sketch graphs quickly to visualize behavior before solving. Use short timed problem sets to practice recognizing function types and applying multiple solving methods, helping you build speed and reduce hesitation in deciding which approach fits best.",
        "For linear functions in word problems, regularly translate scenarios into equations under timed conditions to strengthen your ability to commit to answers promptly. After solving, briefly reflect on the meaning of slope and intercept in context to deepen understanding without slowing your pace.",
        "With systems of linear equations, practice setting up and solving problems using substitution or elimination within strict time limits. Post-practice, review your solution steps to confirm accuracy and note when trusting your first approach led to correct answers, reinforcing decisiveness under pressure."
