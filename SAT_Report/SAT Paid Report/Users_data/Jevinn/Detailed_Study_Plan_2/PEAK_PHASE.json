Use a visible countdown timer to push for faster, accurate identification of supporting data, then review errors to avoid misinterpretation of units or scales.",
                        "Central Ideas and Details": "Practice summarizing complex passages by annotating main ideas and supporting details under timed conditions, then write concise paraphrases to reinforce understanding. Challenge yourself with progressively harder passages to refine your ability to distinguish central ideas from minor details while maintaining calm focus.",

Midweek shifts to moderate skills to build momentum, while Fridays are dedicated to comprehensive review and error analysis. Saturdays feature two full-length practice tests simulating real conditions, emphasizing accuracy and speed optimization, followed by detailed review sessions. Sundays serve as a Flex Day to recharge and adapt."

Experiment with new study tools or techniques to refresh your approach, such as digital annotation apps or alternative note-taking methods. Engage in mixed-skill challenges that combine Math and Reading & Writing in short bursts to maintain cognitive flexibility. Incorporate mindfulness or light physical activity to support mental recovery. Set clear, achievable goals for the upcoming week to maintain purposeful momentum."
