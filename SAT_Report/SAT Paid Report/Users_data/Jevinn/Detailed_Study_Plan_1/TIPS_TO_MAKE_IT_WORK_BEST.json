        "Use timed outlining exercises to quickly identify the form and structure of passages, then challenge yourself to improve your speed without sacrificing accuracy to build a subtle sense of urgency.",
        "Incorporate brief ‘beat your best time’ drills when working on words in context, focusing on using surrounding clues efficiently to determine meanings and avoid overthinking familiar words.",
        "Practice annotating passages by marking signal words and summarizing author purpose in the margins, setting a countdown timer to maintain steady focus and prevent settling for surface-level understanding.",
        "When working on nonlinear functions, set incremental time goals for sketching graphs and solving equations, pushing yourself to complete problems slightly faster each session while maintaining your calm precision.",
        "Translate word problems involving systems of linear equations into equations under timed conditions, then review your work to ensure accuracy, balancing speed with thoughtful verification.",
        "Alternate between substitution and elimination methods in solving systems of equations during timed drills, aiming to identify the most efficient approach quickly and build adaptive problem-solving flexibility."
