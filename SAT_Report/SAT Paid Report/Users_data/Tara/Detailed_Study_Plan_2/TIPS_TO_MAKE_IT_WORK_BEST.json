        "Leverage your strength in structure by outlining each passage’s form and paragraph purpose before answering questions; this will deepen your understanding of the author’s intent and improve accuracy under timed conditions.",
        "Challenge yourself to annotate unfamiliar words actively by identifying context clues and paraphrasing their meanings aloud; this practice will build your vocabulary flexibility and prevent overreliance on memorized definitions.",
        "Incorporate regular exercises that require synthesizing multiple sources by creating comparison charts or writing brief synthesis paragraphs; this will enhance your ability to connect ideas and adapt your thinking beyond routine methods.",
        "Visualize nonlinear function graphs before solving problems to build intuition about their behavior, and practice switching between algebraic and graphical approaches to strengthen your problem-solving flexibility.",
        "Set aside time each study session to review and memorize key area and volume formulas, then apply them in varied word problems to reinforce formula recall and improve your ability to break down complex shapes systematically.",
        "Practice solving systems of linear and quadratic equations using substitution while intentionally varying problem types and checking solutions thoroughly; this will build your confidence in adapting to different question formats and reduce errors."
