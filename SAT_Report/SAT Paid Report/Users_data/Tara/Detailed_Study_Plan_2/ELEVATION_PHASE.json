In Math, reinforce mastery of Lines, angles, and triangles, Systems of two linear equations in two variables, Linear equations in one variable, Percentages, and Linear functions under moderate time pressure. Build endurance to sustain focus during timed practice and develop adaptability by responding effectively to mixed-topic challenges. Demonstrate consistent progress toward the 1590 goal by refining second-tier skills and applying strategic problem-solving with fewer repeated mistakes."

Midweek sessions emphasize moderate skills with increased time pressure and mixed-topic drills to enhance adaptability. Fridays are dedicated to comprehensive review cycles analyzing errors, adapting strategies, and retesting to solidify gains. Saturdays feature one full-length timed SAT practice test followed by an in-depth review of mistakes and reasoning to reinforce endurance and strategic thinking. One Flex Day is incorporated to intentionally disrupt routine, fostering cognitive flexibility and resilience."

Reflect on errors from the week by journaling insights and setting specific goals for improvement. Experiment with new study tools such as flashcard apps or group problem-solving sessions to introduce innovation. Incorporate mindfulness or light physical activity to recharge focus and reduce anxiety from disrupted routines. Use this day to celebrate progress and mentally prepare for the upcoming week with flexible, growth-oriented habits."
