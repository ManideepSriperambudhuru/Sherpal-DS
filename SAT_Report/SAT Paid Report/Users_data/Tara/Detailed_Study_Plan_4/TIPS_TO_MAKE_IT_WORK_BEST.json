        "Leverage your strength in structure by outlining passages briefly to track form and flow, but challenge yourself weekly by rearranging paragraphs or answering questions about alternative structures to build adaptability in unexpected formats.",
        "Use your disciplined routine to annotate challenging vocabulary in diverse passages, then actively paraphrase sentences aloud or in writing to deepen your contextual understanding and avoid relying solely on memorized definitions.",
        "Incorporate regular practice comparing and synthesizing multiple sources by creating graphic organizers and writing brief synthesis paragraphs, while intentionally varying your approach to embrace new rhetorical strategies and improve cognitive flexibility.",
        "Maintain your steady study habits by sketching graphs of nonlinear functions before solving problems, but introduce mixed-topic problem sets that require switching between function types mid-session to build your ability to adapt under time pressure.",
        "Use your organizational skills to memorize and review area and volume formulas consistently, then dedicate weekly sessions to solving composite figure problems and unit conversion drills that force you to adjust your usual problem-solving routine.",
        "Apply your methodical approach to solving systems of linear and quadratic equations by practicing substitution carefully and checking solutions, while incorporating timed practice that requires switching between different solving methods to enhance your flexibility and confidence."
