        "Leverage your strength in structure by outlining each passage’s form and paragraph purpose before answering; this will help you maintain clarity and anticipate question types even when passages vary unexpectedly.",
        "Challenge yourself weekly to annotate unfamiliar words by identifying multiple context clues—definition, contrast, or examples—and paraphrase their meanings aloud to build flexible vocabulary skills beyond rote memorization.",
        "Incorporate brief synthesis exercises where you compare and contrast viewpoints from multiple sources, using transitional phrases to connect ideas; this will strengthen your ability to adapt and weave arguments under timed conditions.",
        "Visualize nonlinear function graphs regularly and practice switching between equation forms and graphs to deepen your conceptual understanding and build confidence in handling varied problem types.",
        "Set aside time to solve area and volume problems by breaking down composite figures into simpler shapes, labeling dimensions clearly, and double-checking unit conversions to avoid careless errors.",
        "Practice solving systems of linear and quadratic equations through substitution with deliberate attention to each step, and build adaptability by interpreting discriminants to anticipate the number of solutions before solving."
