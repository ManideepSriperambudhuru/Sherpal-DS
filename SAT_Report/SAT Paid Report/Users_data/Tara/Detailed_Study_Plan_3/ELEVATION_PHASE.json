Fridays are dedicated to comprehensive review of errors and strategy refinement. Saturdays feature one full-length timed SAT practice test followed by detailed analysis of mistakes and adaptive planning. One designated Flex Day intentionally disrupts routine to build cognitive flexibility and adaptability while supporting rest and reflection."

Experiment with new study tools such as flashcard apps or group problem-solving sessions to break routine. Reflect calmly on recent errors to identify patterns without pressure. Incorporate mindfulness or light physical activity to recharge focus. Set clear, flexible goals for the upcoming week emphasizing both consistency and openness to new strategies."
