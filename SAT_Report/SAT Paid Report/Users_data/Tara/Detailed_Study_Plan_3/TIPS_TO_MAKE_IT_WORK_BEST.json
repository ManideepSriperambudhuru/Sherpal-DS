        "Leverage your strength in structure by outlining passages briefly to track form and flow, but challenge yourself weekly by rearranging paragraph orders or predicting alternative structures to build adaptability in unexpected question formats.",
        "Use your disciplined routine to annotate challenging vocabulary in diverse passages, then actively paraphrase sentences aloud or in writing to deepen your understanding of words in context and avoid relying solely on memorized definitions.",
        "Integrate regular practice of comparing and synthesizing multiple sources by creating graphic organizers and writing brief synthesis paragraphs, while intentionally varying your approach to build flexibility and confidence in connecting ideas under timed conditions.",
        "Maintain your steady study habits by sketching graphs of nonlinear functions before solving problems, but incorporate mixed-topic problem sets that require switching between function types mid-session to enhance your cognitive flexibility and problem-solving agility.",
        "Use your organizational skills to memorize and systematically review area and volume formulas, then apply them in composite figure problems that require breaking down shapes differently each time, helping you adapt when formulas or problem setups vary unexpectedly.",
        "Build endurance by practicing substitution methods for solving systems of linear and quadratic equations daily, but introduce spontaneous checks of your solutions and interpret discriminants under timed conditions to strengthen your ability to adjust strategies when initial approaches donâ€™t work."
