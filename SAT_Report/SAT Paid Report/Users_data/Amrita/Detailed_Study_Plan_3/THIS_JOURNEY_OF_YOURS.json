    "description": "Amrita, your steady and thoughtful approach is your greatest asset as you deepen your mastery of foundational skills like interpreting words in context and solving systems of equations. This Elevation Phase is about disciplined rebuilding—strengthening your understanding of sentence boundaries and nonlinear functions with deliberate focus. Embrace the micro-challenges ahead as opportunities to stretch beyond comfort without sacrificing your calm balance. Remember, true growth comes from pushing just enough to build momentum, not from avoiding struggle altogether. Your ability to reflect and maintain emotional stability will keep you grounded as you refine complex concepts and sharpen problem-solving strategies. Keep recognizing each small win; they are the building blocks of your progress toward a 1590. This is your path—steady, purposeful, and entirely within your control."
