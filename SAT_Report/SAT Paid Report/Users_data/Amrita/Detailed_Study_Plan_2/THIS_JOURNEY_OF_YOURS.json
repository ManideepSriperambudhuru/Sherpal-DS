    "description": "Amrita, your steady and thoughtful approach is your greatest asset as you deepen your mastery of foundational skills like interpreting words in context and solving systems of equations. This phase calls for disciplined rebuildingâ€”reviewing core concepts with intention and embracing micro-challenges that stretch your limits without disrupting your balance. Remember, true growth comes from pushing just beyond comfort, not avoiding the struggle. Your calm resilience and self-awareness position you well to transform moments of difficulty into meaningful progress. Lean into the process of layering complexity gradually, and use your natural ability to reflect and adapt to maintain momentum. As you elevate your skills, keep sight of the long-term goal: a confident, well-rounded performance that reflects both your intellectual rigor and emotional steadiness."
