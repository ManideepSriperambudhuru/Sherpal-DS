            "description": "Achieve measurable improvement in accuracy and reasoning for both Math and Reading & Writing by reducing careless errors and reinforcing partially mastered skills. Demonstrate increased cognitive flexibility under moderate time pressure through strategic practice. Establish a consistent pattern of performance review cycles to analyze mistakes, adapt strategies, and retest with improved precision. Progress steadily toward bridging the gap from 1190 to 1590 by embracing incremental challenges that push beyond comfort zones without disrupting emotional balance."

                        "Percentages": "Complete medium-difficulty percentage problems involving conversions, increases, decreases, and word problems by writing out each step clearly and estimating answers before final calculation to reduce errors and build fluency with real-world contexts.",
                        "Area and volume": "Tackle the most challenging area and volume problems by breaking composite figures into simpler shapes, calculating stepwise under timed conditions, and verifying units and formulas meticulously to improve speed and precision.",
                        "One-variable data: Distributions and measures of center and spread": "Analyze medium-level data sets by calculating mean, median, range, and IQR manually, then interpret graphical representations such as box plots and histograms to identify shape and outliers, reinforcing conceptual understanding through applied practice.",
                        "Ratios, rates, proportional relationships, and units": "Master complex ratio and proportion problems by setting up and solving multi-step equations with unit conversions, writing all units explicitly, and practicing under timed conditions to enhance accuracy and speed while maintaining composure."

Saturdays focus on one full-length timed practice test followed by detailed answer review to identify patterns and adapt strategies. Sundays serve as a Flex Day to support rest, reflection, and flexible engagement aligned with personal well-being."

Experiment with new study tools or techniques such as digital flashcards or timed mini-quizzes to gamify learning gently. Participate in mixed-skill challenges with peers slightly more intense to stimulate motivation without overwhelming. Incorporate mindfulness or light physical activity like walking or yoga to sustain emotional stability. Set clear, achievable goals for the upcoming week to maintain steady, sustainable progress."
