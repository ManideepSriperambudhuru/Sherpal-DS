                        "Command of Evidence - Quantitative": "Practice with SAT-style passages containing embedded graphs and tables, focusing on locating precise numerical evidence to support claims, using stepwise elimination of distractors and paraphrasing data to confirm comprehension within timed drills.",
                        "Rhetorical Synthesis": "Complete synthesis exercises that require comparing multiple short passages, identifying rhetorical appeals and relationships, and writing concise paragraphs that integrate evidence with clear transitions, emphasizing clarity and logical flow under timed conditions.",
                        "Cross-text Connections": "Work on paired passage sets where you identify agreements, contradictions, and author purposes, using graphic organizers to map relationships, followed by answering synthesis questions that demand integration of ideas across texts with accuracy and speed."
