    "description": "Amrita, your steady and thoughtful approach is your greatest asset as you deepen your mastery of foundational skills like interpreting words in context and solving systems of equations. This phase is about disciplined rebuildingâ€”strengthening your understanding of sentence boundaries and nonlinear functions with deliberate focus. Embrace the micro-challenges ahead as opportunities to stretch beyond comfort without sacrificing your inner balance. Remember, true growth comes from pushing just enough to build momentum, not from avoiding difficulty. Your calm resilience and self-awareness position you well to sustain consistent progress. Keep reflecting on how each small win contributes to your larger goal of a 1590 SAT score. This is a marathon, not a sprint, and your balanced persistence will carry you through. Trust the process, lean into the challenge, and own every step forward."
