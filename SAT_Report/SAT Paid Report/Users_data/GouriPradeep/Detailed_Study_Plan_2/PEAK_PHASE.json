Midweek shifts to moderate skills such as Command of Evidence and One-variable data to deepen reasoning and speed. Fridays are dedicated to comprehensive review of errors and strategy refinement. Saturdays feature two full-length, timed practice tests simulating real exam conditions to build endurance and confidence, followed by detailed mistake analysis and reflection. Sunday serves as a Flex Day for rest, reflection, and adaptive practice aligned with personal energy and focus."
