        "Leverage your curiosity by actively outlining the form and structure of passages during reading sessions. Use visual aids like flowcharts or color-coded notes to track paragraph purposes and transitions, helping you maintain focus and deepen your understanding of logical flow.",
        "Turn vocabulary practice into an interactive game by creating flashcards with context clues and multiple meanings. Challenge yourself to paraphrase sentences aloud or in writing, reinforcing your grasp of nuanced word usage while keeping study sessions dynamic and engaging.",
        "Build your command of evidence skills by pairing up with a study buddy to discuss and identify textual support for answers. Use this collaborative approach to stay accountable, practice active reading, and develop a habit of verifying evidence systematically under timed conditions.",
        "Visualize nonlinear functions by sketching graphs during study sessions, breaking down complex equations into manageable parts. Incorporate short, timed challenges focused on identifying key features like vertices and intercepts to sustain your attention and build confidence incrementally.",
        "Approach linear functions by translating word problems into equations using diagrams or tables. Set small goals to write and solve one equation per session, celebrating each success to maintain motivation and reinforce your understanding of slope and intercept concepts.",
        "Strengthen your skills with systems of linear equations by practicing step-by-step problem translation and solution methods. Use habit trackers to monitor your progress and schedule brief, focused sessions with a peer or mentor to review mistakes and solidify your problem-solving strategies."
