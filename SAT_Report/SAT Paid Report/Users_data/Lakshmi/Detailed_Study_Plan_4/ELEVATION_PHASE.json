            "description": "Each week, steadily reduce careless errors by reinforcing accuracy in both Math and Reading & Writing. Achieve measurable improvement in second-tier skills such as Command of Evidence - Quantitative and Lines, angles, and triangles through targeted practice under moderate time pressure. Enhance reasoning agility by applying strategic problem-solving techniques and adapting based on performance reviews. Maintain consistent progress markers while balancing effort with mental resilience to avoid burnout."

                        "Text Structure and Purpose": "Work on challenging SAT passages focusing on complex organizational patterns; outline the authorâ€™s structure and purpose for each paragraph, then answer inference and purpose questions to refine advanced analytical techniques while monitoring timing.",
                        "Rhetorical Synthesis": "Master the most difficult synthesis questions by practicing sets of paired passages; summarize and compare rhetorical strategies quickly, then answer synthesis questions with a focus on speed and accuracy under timed constraints."

                        "Right triangles and trigonometry": "Build foundational skills by solving basic right triangle problems using sine, cosine, and tangent; label sides relative to angles carefully, use a calculator accurately for ratios and inverse functions, and verify answers for reasonableness.",
                        "Percentages": "Work through medium-difficulty percentage problems involving conversions, increases, decreases, and real-world contexts; write out each step explicitly to avoid errors and estimate results to check for plausibility.",

Midweek sessions focus on moderately mastered skills to build confidence and fluency. Fridays are dedicated to reviewing errors and adapting strategies based on performance data. Saturdays involve one full-length timed practice test followed by a thorough review to identify patterns and reinforce learning. Sundays serve as a Flex Day to support rest, reflection, and mental resilience."

Experiment with mindfulness techniques such as guided breathing or short meditation to prevent burnout. Engage in mixed-skill challenges that combine Math and Reading & Writing in a relaxed setting to maintain cognitive flexibility. Incorporate light physical activity to refresh focus and set clear, adaptable goals for the upcoming week, reinforcing balance and sustainable consistency."
