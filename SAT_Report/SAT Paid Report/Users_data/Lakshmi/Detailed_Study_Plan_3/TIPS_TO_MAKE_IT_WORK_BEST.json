        "When working on Words in Context, leverage your determination by actively annotating passages to identify context clues like synonyms, antonyms, and contrasts. Regularly paraphrase challenging sentences to deepen understanding, but balance this with brief reflective pauses to avoid burnout and reinforce learning.",
        "For mastering Form, Structure, and Sense, create a consistent routine of outlining passages and noting transitions to track logical flow. Use your focus to critically evaluate paragraph purposes, but integrate short mindfulness breaks to maintain clarity and prevent hyper-focus from causing fatigue.",
        "In practicing Boundaries, systematically identify independent clauses and practice rewriting sentences with correct punctuation. Use your resilience to review errors carefully, but remind yourself that seeking feedback or help when stuck is a strength, not a weakness, to sustain progress without burnout.",
        "When studying Nonlinear Functions, capitalize on your ambition by sketching graphs and memorizing key formulas daily. To maintain stamina, intersperse problem-solving with brief rest intervals and reflect on your problem-solving process to build mental resilience and adaptability.",
        "For Systems of Linear and Quadratic Equations, apply your structured approach by mastering substitution and verifying solutions meticulously. Schedule regular check-ins to assess progress and incorporate journaling to reframe setbacks as learning opportunities rather than personal failures.",
        "While working on Systems of Two Linear Equations, use your consistency to practice multiple solving methods and word problems. Balance intense study sessions with planned breaks and self-compassion exercises to sustain motivation and prevent burnout as you push toward your ambitious score goal."
