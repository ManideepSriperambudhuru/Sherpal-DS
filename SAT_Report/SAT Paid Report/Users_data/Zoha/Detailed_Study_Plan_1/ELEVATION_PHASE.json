Fridays focus on reviewing errors and adapting strategies based on performance insights. Saturdays are dedicated to a full-length timed practice test followed by a thorough review session to identify patterns in mistakes and reinforce decision-making confidence. Sundays serve as a Flex Day to rest, reflect, and prepare mentally for the upcoming week."
