        "When encountering challenging vocabulary, focus on identifying context clues such as definitions, contrasts, or examples within the passage rather than relying on memorized meanings. Practice paraphrasing sentences aloud or in writing to deepen your conceptual understanding and build confidence in your interpretations.",
        "Develop a habit of briefly outlining the structure of each passage as you read, noting the purpose of paragraphs and transitions. This will help you connect ideas more efficiently and reduce overanalysis by giving you a clear roadmap of the authorâ€™s argument or narrative flow.",
        "Incorporate timed writing drills where you consciously use a variety of transition words to link ideas smoothly. After each practice, review your work to identify which transitions enhanced clarity and which felt forced, helping you build intuitive judgment for effective, natural writing under time constraints.",
        "Practice solving systems of linear and quadratic equations by focusing on mastering substitution techniques with timed drills. After each problem, quickly verify your solutions to build trust in your instincts and reduce hesitation during the test.",
        "When working on word problems involving systems of linear equations, create clear variable labels and write out your equations step-by-step. Set a strict time limit per problem to encourage decisive action, then review errors to understand where overthinking slowed you down.",
        "Visualize nonlinear functions by sketching their graphs before solving equations, especially under timed conditions. Use multiple solving methods when stuck, but practice choosing the most efficient approach quickly to build confidence and reduce decision paralysis."
