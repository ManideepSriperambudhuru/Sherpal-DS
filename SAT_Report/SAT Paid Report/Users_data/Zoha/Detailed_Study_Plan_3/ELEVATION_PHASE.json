                        "Boundaries": "Practice mastering the most difficult boundary questions under strict time limits, using targeted drills that require quick identification of passage limits and transitions, then review errors immediately to confirm when your initial instincts were correct to build trust in your decision-making.",

Begin the week targeting your weakest skills to build momentum and confidence, midweek shift to moderate skills to reinforce and layer complexity, and reserve Fridays for comprehensive review and error analysis to adapt strategies. Saturdays are dedicated to one full-length SAT practice test under timed conditions, followed by an in-depth review to identify patterns in mistakes and hesitation. Sundays serve as a Flex Day to rest, reflect, and recalibrate for the week ahead."

Experiment with new study tools or techniques that stimulate intellectual curiosity without pressure, such as concept mapping or discussion with peers. Tackle mixed-skill challenge sets at a relaxed pace to maintain cognitive flexibility. Incorporate mindfulness or light physical activity to reset mental energy. Set clear, purpose-driven goals for the upcoming week to maintain motivation aligned with your thoughtful learning style."
