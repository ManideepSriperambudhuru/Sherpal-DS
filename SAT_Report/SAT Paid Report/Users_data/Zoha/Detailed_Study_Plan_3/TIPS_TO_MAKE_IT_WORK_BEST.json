        "When encountering challenging vocabulary, focus on identifying context clues such as definitions, contrasts, or examples within the passage rather than relying on memorized meanings. Practice paraphrasing sentences aloud or in writing to deepen your conceptual understanding and build confidence in your interpretations.",
        "Develop a habit of briefly outlining the structure of each passage as you read, noting the purpose of paragraphs and transitions. This will help you connect ideas more efficiently and reduce overanalysis by providing a clear roadmap of the authorâ€™s argument or narrative flow.",
        "Incorporate timed writing drills where you consciously use a variety of transition words to link ideas smoothly. After each practice, review your work to identify which transitions enhanced clarity and which felt forced, helping you build intuitive judgment for effective, natural writing.",
        "Practice solving systems of linear and quadratic equations by setting strict time limits per problem to simulate test conditions. After each session, review your solutions to confirm when your first instinct was correct, reinforcing trust in your decision-making under pressure.",
        "When working on word problems involving systems of linear equations, create clear variable labels and write out your equations step-by-step. Use timed drills to improve speed, and always verify your answers by substitution to build accuracy and reduce hesitation during the test.",
        "Visualize nonlinear functions by sketching their graphs before solving equations, focusing on key features like vertex and intercepts. Use timed practice to improve your ability to quickly identify function types and apply multiple solving methods, building confidence to act decisively during the exam."
