Allocate two days each to these areas with targeted practice, interspersed with days covering foundational skills like Area and volume, Linear equations in two variables, and Reading skills such as Form, Structure, and Sense and Words in Context.

Reflect on your progress and adjust your study approach as needed, allowing space for rest and mental reset without introducing new content. This intentional disruption will strengthen your adaptability while honoring your steady, disciplined nature.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"
