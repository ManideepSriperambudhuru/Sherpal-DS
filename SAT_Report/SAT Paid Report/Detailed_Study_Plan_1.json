				"title": "Weekly Structure",
				"description": "Over the nine-day phase from June 5 to June 13, focus on the three weakest skills identified: Nonlinear functions, Rhetorical Synthesis, and Nonlinear equations in one variable and systems of equations in two variables. Allocate two days each to these areas with targeted practice, interspersed with days covering foundational skills like Area and volume, Linear equations in two variables, and Reading skills such as Form, Structure, and Sense and Words in Context. One day will be reserved as a flex day to break routine and build cognitive flexibility."

				"title": "Flex Day Activities",
				"description": "Use the flex day to engage in mixed-topic quizzes that require quick shifts in focus, practice spontaneous oral explanations of concepts to build mental agility, and try new study tools like digital flashcards or collaborative problem-solving with peers. Reflect on your progress and adjust your study approach as needed, allowing space for rest and mental reset without introducing new content. This intentional disruption will strengthen your adaptability while honoring your steady, disciplined nature."
