# Qdrant + LangChain Chatbot

This project implements a conversational AI chatbot using LangChain, OpenAI embeddings & chat models, and Qdrant vector database for semantic search. It supports document ingestion from Word files, chat memory, and can be deployed locally or with Qdrant Cloud.

---

## Features

-   Load and embed Word documents to create a semantic vector store
-   Use OpenAI embeddings and chat models via LangChain
-   Support conversation memory with LangChain’s ConversationBufferMemory
-   Switchable vector store: Qdrant local (Docker) or Qdrant Cloud
-   Semantic search-based retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
-   Easy environment configuration via `.env`

---

## Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   Docker (for local Qdrant setup) or Qdrant Cloud account
-   OpenAI API key
-   Qdrant API key & URL (for cloud)

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
```
````

### 2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate      # Linux/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows PowerShell
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following keys:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo

# For Qdrant Cloud usage:
QDRANT_CLOUD_URL=https://your-cloud-url
QDRANT_API_KEY=your-qdrant-api-key

# For local Qdrant (optional):
QDRANT_LOCAL_URL=http://localhost:6333
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual API keys and URLs.

### 5. Running Qdrant locally (optional)

If you prefer local setup instead of cloud:

-   Install Docker

-   Run Qdrant container:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
    ```

-   Update `.env` to:

    ```env
    QDRANT_CLOUD_URL=http://localhost:6333
    QDRANT_API_KEY=           # leave empty for local
    ```

### 6. Prepare your documents

Place your `.docx` Word files inside a folder (e.g., `docs/`) in the project.

### 7. Embed documents and create vector store

Run your document embedding script or call the `embed_and_store_documents` function, providing the folder path and collection name.

### 8. Run the chatbot

```bash
python main.py
```

Type your queries. Type `exit` to stop.

## Notes

-   The code automatically switches between local Qdrant or cloud Qdrant based on the environment variables.
-   Ensure your OpenAI API key has proper permissions for embeddings and chat completions.
-   The system supports text cleanup and splitting for better embedding quality.
-   For advanced use, modify the vector store settings in `retriever_setup.py`.

---

## Troubleshooting

-   **SSL errors connecting to Qdrant Cloud**:
    Make sure your `QDRANT_CLOUD_URL` starts with `https://` and the API key is valid.

-   **No collections found**:
    Ensure documents are properly embedded and vector store collections created before running the chat.

-   **Import errors**:
    Confirm all dependencies are installed and environment is activated.
